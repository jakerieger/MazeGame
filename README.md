# Maze Game

Maze Game is a 2D multiplayer maze racing game where you and 2 other players
compete to be the first one to find the cave exit. Caves are randomly generated
and get progressively more difficult each round.

> This game was developed as a means of showcasing my technical programming knowledge to potential employers and is not actively maintained as a released game.
